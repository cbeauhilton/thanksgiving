 BRINE
 - 1 1/2 Cup kosher salt
 - 3/4 Cup bourbon
 - 3/4 Cup pure maple syrup
 - 1/2 Cup brown sugar
 - 1 onion, peeled and quartered
 - 3 bay leaves, crushed
 - 4 Strips orange peel
 - 2 Tablespoon black peppercorns
 - 1 Tablespoon whole cloves

 MAIN
 - 1 (12-14 lb) turkey, fresh or thawed
 - 1 Cup butter, melted
 - 1/4 Cup pure maple syrup
 - Traeger Pork & Poultry Rub or salt and pepper
 - sprigs of fresh sage and thyme, for serving
 - orange wedges, lady apples or kumquats, for serving

 STEPS
 1. Note: Do not use a kosher turkey or a self-basting turkey for this recipe as they have already been enhanced with a salt-solution.
 2. For the Brine: In a large stockpot or container, combine 5 quarts hot water, kosher salt, bourbon, 3/4 cup of the maple syrup, brown sugar, onion, bay leaves, orange peel, peppercorns, and cloves and stir until well mixed.

 INGREDIENTS
 - 1 1/2 Cup kosher salt
 - 3/4 Cup bourbon
 - 3/4 Cup pure maple syrup
 - 1/2 Cup brown sugar
 - 1 onion, peeled and quartered
 - 3 bay leaves, crushed
 - 4 Strips orange peel
 - 2 Tablespoon black peppercorns
 - 1 Tablespoon whole cloves

 3. Add 3 quarts ice. Rinse the turkey, inside and out, under cold running water. Remove giblets and gravy packet and discard or save for another use.

 INGREDIENTS
 - 1 (12-14 lb) turkey, fresh or thawed

 4. Add the turkey to the brine and refrigerate 8 to 12 hours, or overnight. Weigh down with a bag of ice to keep the bird submerged.
 5. Drain and pat turkey dry with paper towels; discard the brine.
 6. To Spatchcock the Turkey: With a large knife or shears, cut the bird open along the backbone on both sides through the ribs and remove the backbone. Once the bird is open, split the breastbone to spread the bird flat; this will allow it to roast evenly.
 7. Combine the melted butter and the remaining 1/4 cup of maple syrup and divide in half.

 INGREDIENTS
 - 1 Cup butter, melted
 - 1/4 Cup pure maple syrup

 8. Brush half of the mixture on the bird and sprinkle with Traeger Pork & Poultry Rub or salt and black pepper. Set aside the other half of the mixture until ready to use.

 INGREDIENTS
 - As Needed Traeger Pork & Poultry Rub or salt and pepper

 9. When ready to cook, set Traeger temperature to 350℉ and preheat, lid closed for 15 minutes. Grill: 350 ˚F
 10. Roast the turkey until the internal temperature in the thickest part of the breast reaches 165℉, about 2-3 hours.
 11. Brush with the remaining butter-maple syrup glaze the last 30 minutes of cooking.
 12. Let the turkey rest for 15 to 20 minutes before carving.
 13. Garnish, if desired, with fresh herbs and or kumquats. Enjoy!

 INGREDIENTS
 - sprigs of fresh sage and thyme, for serving

## sweet potato casserole

https://celebratingsweets.com/sweet-potato-casserole-with-marshmallow-pecan-streusel/

### Ingredients

Main
- 3 to 3- ¼ pounds sweet potatoes*, peeled and chopped into large chunks, see note
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ¼ cup milk or half and half
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- salt, to taste

Topping
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- ¼ cup all purpose flour, for a sturdier streusel add and additional heaping tablespoon of flour
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ⅛ teaspoon salt
- ½ cup chopped pecans
- 2 -3 cups mini marshmallows, or more, if you’d like

### Instructions
Main
- Preheat oven to 375°F. Grease a 2 or 2 ½ quart casserole dish (preferably a rectangle or oval so there's a decent surface area for the topping; I use an 8×11) and set aside.
- Place the sweet potatoes in a large pot, cover with water, and boil until tender (about 7 minutes, depending on the size). Drain really well and return to the pot. Add butter, milk, cinnamon, brown sugar and salt to the potatoes and mash until smooth. Use a hand mixer, if desired, to make them extra smooth. Taste the potatoes and add additional seasonings, if desired.
- Transfer the mashed potatoes to the prepared casserole dish. Place in the oven until heated through (if they're already warm it will only take a few minutes). While the sweet potatoes are heating, prepare the topping.

Topping
- In a medium bowl, combine butter, brown sugar, flour, cinnamon and salt (I use a fork or rubber spatula to stir and mash the mixture), then mix in pecans.
- Remove the sweet potatoes from the oven. Top with half the marshmallows, then sprinkle half the streusel over the marshmallows (pinching pieces together with your fingers). Top with the other half of the marshmallows and sprinkle the remaining streusel over the top. Place back into the oven for 8-15 minutes, until the topping is bubbly and golden brown (keep an eye on it so the marshmallows don't burn). You can also place it under the broiler very briefly to add a little more color to the marshmallows. Note: the longer it is in the oven the more likely that the marshmallows will begin to melt. Allow to sit at room temperature for several minutes before serving.

MAKE AHEAD TIPS:
- You can assemble the cooked and seasoned mashed sweet potatoes in a casserole dish and refrigerate tightly covered for 2 days (without any topping).
 You can also prepare the streusel topping (without the marshmallows) and refrigerate that separately.
- Before serving, bring the streusel topping to room temperature. Heat the potatoes (without any topping) in the oven at 375°F until heated all the way through (30-ish minutes depending on the size of your casserole dish). Or speed it along by microwaving. Once the potatoes are warmed through, sprinkle on the marshmallows and streusel and return to the oven for 8-15 minutes, until the marshmallows are lightly toasted (broil briefly for a darker color).
